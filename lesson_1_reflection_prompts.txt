How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   through the differences to find the syntax or semantics typo

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   you can easily find the changes that how the things going on , and may avoid some typos, 
   and more easy to undo some changes.
   on the other hand, for the sharing documents, it's more convenient to combine many 
   different ideas into one documents.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manually saving a version may more logic, saving by logic change could make you 
	easy to recall the change's details, and do not disturb your coding.
	the shortcoming is you must have the awareness to choose to save a version, and 
	as far as possible to saving a logic change , otherwise, it will be hard to read the changes
	for the automatically saving, the advantage is you could foget the version things, 
	but ,this will lead to chaotic version changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because the relationship between multiple files are may be very complicated,
	allow saving multiple files in one commit, it might convenient to user but hard
	to system to handle it,

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Using command to find the time point, and using command git diff to find the details
	between the old version

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I have these good old versions, so I can get back to old versions and find the bugs,
	and don't worry to completely destroy it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use it to learn new code language, start manage my code and programmer
